What you need:
- sqlite installed
- xampp installed
- some kind of version control system. I recommend source tree
	- download that if you havn't already
	- set up a repository on your local machine, and pull from our github page
		- to do this
			- log into github
			- go to our repository, click overview
				- you should see a URL, select it and copy it
			- now in source tree (or whatever version control you are using) click clone/new,
				- click clone the clone repo tab 
					-(in source tree its the default option when you click clone/new)
				- paste the url into the source path
			- IMPORTANTL: set up the destination path to somewhere in c:/xampp/htdocs 
					- I RECOMEND naming it AllStarDB so the paths are the same for all of us
					-(this will your current working version be accessible from local host)
			- create branch named lastname_development
			- checkout that branch (if it doesn't automatically when you create the branch)
			- you are now ready to develop (just make sure while you work your development branch is checkout)
			- NOTE: you can create as many branches as you want, just name them lastname_development_v01 ...
				- I recommend you do that any time you start making a major change that you may want to revert.
					- if you screw something, stage then commit your changes you want to revert, then just checkout the branch version before, and all the changes will be reverted
	Version Control directions:
			To COMMIT: this is you updating your branch with your changes
				-(must be done before merge)
				- MAKE SURE the branch you want to update is checkout (if the wrong one is checkout you will update the wrong version)
				- first STAGE your changes (see to stage section)
				- then commit (in source tree simply click commit button (next to clone button)
			To STAGE:
				- in source tree, click on working copy (below file status)
					- then click unstaged file checkbox
			To MERGE:
				- make sure you have a stable version
				- commit your changes (MAKE SURE your development branch is checked out)
				- pull from the server (see To PULL from server below)
				- run the master version you just pulled, make sure it runs
				- checkout master branch
				- click merge
				- select your development branch
				- this has just merged your version locally, now its time to push it to the server
			To PUSH to server:
				- simply click push and select the branches you want to push (i recommend pushing all branches)
			To PULL from server:
				- simply click pull
				- you may have to go to repository->repository settings -> advanced -> uncheck use global user settings -> enter your name and email -> ok
					- you will probably have to do that prior to pushing (it will give you an error if you don't
				
To use xampp:
- open xampp
- click start apache (should be the first start button)
	- when you are running the server (what you just did) the folder c:/xampp/htdocs 
		is now accessible to your web-browsers by going typing localhost as the url
		- so if you have your repository in c:/xampp/htdocs/AllStarDB and you want to run index.html
		- simply go to localhost/AllStarDB/index.html
			- this should behave as if it was on the server
